# BatchTracer
Enterprise-level tool designed and written on my personal computer.

#This script is easy to use
#Simply drop into a folder with a txt file containing your CIDR-notated subnets and execute the script using:
#python BatchTracer.py
#and then enter the name of the text file containing the desired subnets.
#Your results will be collated into a file named BATCH-RESULTS.txt
#The individual tracert executions will be captured in their own files for closer scrutiny

Program can be demoed using the attached Subnets file as a source.
